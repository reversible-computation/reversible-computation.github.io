[Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/) graduated from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Milwaukee, and has been a professor at Cornell University, Queen's University and McGill University, where he is now an Emeritus professor.
His research has always been at the crossing of computer science, mathematics and physics, and his earliest contribution to quantum causality and dynamics dates from 2003.
He has also contributed significantly to programming languages, probabilistic systems, and relativity study.
Among the many awards and prizes he received stands [the LICS Test of Time Award](https://lics.siglog.org/archive/test-of-time-award.html), awarded *twice* (in 2017 and 2022).

### Abstract -- Why are quantum conditionals problematic?

[Hannah Earley](https://ha.nnah.io/) is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of [Vaire Computing](https://vaire.co/), where she leads the development of reversible computing architectures for ultra-low-energy AI workloads.
Vaire's approach aims to overcome the energy limits of conventional silicon by leveraging resonant logic and adiabatic switching, moving computation closer to thermodynamic efficiency.

Hannah holds a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from the University of Cambridge, where she focused on the mathematical foundations of computation and physics-informed models of logic.
