# Call For Papers
        
Reversible computation has a growing number of promising application areas such as low-power electronics, encoding/decoding, debugging, testing and verification, database recovery, discrete event simulation, the modeling of biochemical systems, and reversible algorithms, specification formalisms, programming languages and process algebras.
Furthermore, reversible logic provides a basis for quantum computation with its applications, for example, in cryptography and in the development of highly efficient algorithms.
First reversible circuits and quantum circuits have been implemented and are seen as promising alternatives to conventional <abbr title="Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor">CMOS</abbr> technology.

The 18th edition of the Reversible Computation conference will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in Reversible Computation. This includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers, tutorials, tool demonstrations, and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference. Invited talks by leading international experts will complete the program. Contributions on all areas of Reversible Computation are welcome, including---but not limited to---the following topics:

    Applications
    Architectures
    Algorithms
    Bidirectional transformations
    Circuit Design
    Debugging
    Fault Tolerance and Error Correction
    Hardware
    Information Theory
    Physical Realizations
    Programming Languages
    Program Transformation and Optimisation
    Quantum Computation
    Software
    Synthesis
    Theoretical Results
    Testing
    Verification

In order to submit a paper to the Reversible Computation conference, please follow these guidelines:

You can submit

    full research papers (15 pages maximum, not including references),
    tutorials (15 pages maximum, not including references),
    work-in-progress or tool demonstration papers (6 pages maximum, not including references). 

Please do not forget to clearly indicate the type of your submission by choosing the proper category on the submission page. Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version — for example, details of proofs — may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.

The paper submission will be accepted as a PDF file using the LNCS style. Further information and templates are available here. Authors are encouraged to include their ORCID's in the paper.

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. We would appreciate if one person would not present more than two papers at the conference: if more than two papers are accepted by a group of authors, we kindly ask that the papers be presented by different co-authors, as far as possible. PC chairs and general chairs are not permitted to submit papers to the conference.

All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume.
Submission system
Papers are to be submitted via EasyChair.
